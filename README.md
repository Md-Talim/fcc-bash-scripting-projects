# Bash Scripting Projects - freeCodeCamp

This repository contains Bash scripting projects created while learning Bash scripting on freeCodeCamp.

## Description

This repository holds my solutions for the "Learn Bash Scripting by Building Five Programs" curriculum on freeCodeCamp. The projects demonstrate fundamental Bash scripting concepts, including variables, conditionals, loops, functions, input handling, and operators.

## Projects

1.  **questionnaire.sh:** Asks basic questions like name, location, and favorite coding website.
2.  **countdown.sh:** Takes an integer argument and counts down to zero with a one-second interval.
3.  **bingo.sh:** Generates a random number.
4.  **fortune.sh:** Asks a question and provides a random response from a predefined array.
5.  **five.sh:** Executes all five programs in sequence.

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Md-Talim/fcc-bash-scripting-projects.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd fcc-bash-scripting-projects
    ```
3.  Make the desired script executable (example with `questionnaire.sh`):

    ```
    chmod +x questionnaire.sh
    ```
4.  Run the script (example with `questionnaire.sh`):

    ```
    ./questionnaire.sh
    ```

    For `countdown.sh`, provide an integer argument:
    ```
    ./countdown.sh 10
    ```

## Learned Concepts

*   Variables
*   Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
*   Loops (`for`, `while`, `until`)
*   Functions
*   Handling Input
*   Operators
